# Ubuntu 24.04 , g++-11.4.0 and Cuda 12.8
#
# Note: cofigure exaNBody with EXANB_BUILD_CONTRIB_MD=ON to enable contributed MD potentials
# in exaStamp (i.e ML SNAP)

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \

# common build and cleanup
make -j20 install

# first time environment setup so you can use raw executable without wrapper script
source ./exaDEM

# run executable, with or without profiling tools
/home/carrardt/local/onika/bin/onika-exec mytest.msp


# Additional notes :
# follow instructions in doc/build-exemples.txt in both onika and exaNBody
# use branch main for onika and release-2.0 for exaNBody
# IMPORTANT !!
# to have 32bits integer particle types in exaDEM, you must set the following cmake
# variable when configuring exaNBody :
# XNB_PARTICLE_TYPE_INT=uint32_t
